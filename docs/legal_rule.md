### ⚠️ Branding & Legal Guidelines

When creating a custom Ubuntu-based distribution:

* **Ubuntu recommends** building your distro on their base system, but you **must not use their logos or official name** in your branding.
* **Edit system identification files** such as `/etc/lsb-release` and `/etc/os-release` to reflect your own distribution name.
* **Customize the boot experience**: replace the default GRUB splash image, Plymouth theme, and other branded visuals with your own graphics.

Following these steps ensures your custom ISO is **legally compliant** while maintaining a professional appearance.
